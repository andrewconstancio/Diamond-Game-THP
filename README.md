# Diamond Slot Machine Game

- My approach to this game was use native iOS components to make it look like a slot machine. I went with UIKit for this game and created a game engine and slot machine to drive the state and logic of this app. 

## Features 

- Spin the slow wheels with the play button.
- Randomly generate 3 symbols for the outcome for the round.
- If 3 symbols match the match is won. 
- Ability to add more credits. 

## Assumptions 

- The payout amount is bet amount * symbol multiplier amount. 
- A round is won if 3 symbols match. 

## How to run 

- Clone the repository.
- Open with xCode.
- Choose an iPad as the target device. 
- Run app.
